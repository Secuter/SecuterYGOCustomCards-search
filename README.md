# SecuterYGOCustomCards
This is a simple site created to provide a quick preview of the cards.
It doesn't load all 1000+ card images right away on page load but only downloads the needed ones when an archetype is selected, depending on your connection speed it may take a while if you click multiple archetypes quickly. :D
